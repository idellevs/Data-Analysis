abstract: 
  "Geospatial visualization provides powerful tools for understanding how location influences economic and social phenomena. In the context of real estate markets, spatial analysis reveals patterns in property values, highlights regional disparities, and supports evidence‑based decision making for investors, policymakers, and consumers. This presentation demonstrates how R can be leveraged to transform raw real estate data into meaningful geographic insights. Using packages like **ggplot2**, we illustrate methods for preparing spatial datasets, generating maps, and identifying price hotspots across different regions. By integrating geospatial visualization into real estate research, there can be a clearer understanding of market dynamics."

# Geospatial Information

''Geospatial data'' refers to information that specifies the spatial position of something on the Earth’s surface and describes their associated characteristics. It usually combines three parts: the location (such as coordinates on a map), details about the thing or event (its features or characteristics), and time (when it happened or how long it lasted).(@IBM).

''Geospatial analytics'' involves examining geographically referenced data to identify underlying patterns, trends, and meaningful insights.(@UMW)

''Geographic Information System'' is a computer program that examines and presents data with spatial references. (@USGS)

# GIS in property valuation

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have become a key tool in modern property valuation, helping to address the biases and shortcomings of old appraisal methods. By combining spatial data with hedonic models, automated valuation models, and artificial intelligence, GIS improves the accuracy, clarity, and speed of real estate market analysis.(@ISPRS)

# Spatial evaluation methods

## Spatial Econometric techniques 

There are three main types of spatial econometric methods. The first is the Spatial Lag Model, which looks at how nearby property prices affect each other. The second is the Spatial Error Model, which helps fix problems caused by similar patterns in errors across different areas. The third is the Spatial Durbin Model, which considers how both the outcome and the factors influencing it are affected by nearby areas.(@ICCSA)

# Real Estate Market Visual Analysis

Machine learning can be used to analyze different real estate market data. It helps to easily analyze correlations and relationships within different variables across different market data. It allows for easier understanding of emerging and growing trends.(@regensburg)

## Types of Real Estate Market Data

- Property Listings Data (addresses, prices, property type, size)
- Rental Market Data (monthly rent, vacancy rates, neighborhood attributes)
- Transaction History (sale dates, prices, buyer/seller info)
- Geographic/Demographic Data (census, income levels, population density)
- Construction & Development Data (new projects, zoning, permits)
- Mortgage & Interest Rate Data (loan terms, rate trends)
